<h2> Supported</h2>
 <p>Were supporting only two programming languages atm. These are Javascript and Typescript. We are making Fuschia specific for Javascript but because we are making it in Typescript it will also work with Typescript. There are no plans to bring Fuschia to other programming languages.</p>
  <h3> Supported Languages</h3>
  <ul>
   <li>Javascript</li>
   <li>Typescript</li></ul>
<h2> Tests</h2>
<p>Thank you for contributing to Fuschia!

Before creating a pull request with new development, please run the tests to ensure that everything is working great. It would also be a good idea to run the tests before starting development to distinguish problems between your environment and the Fuschia software. </p>
